Serbz's Python Template

1. Attempts to automatically install any missing imports (needs perfected guesses 4 times if fails the first) but usually works4
   
2. Automatically creates a backup of itself, and fixes indexing (replaces tabs with spaces so you don't get mismatched indexing) - useful when editing and running a script over and over, and then searching for previous changes if they get lost in your IDE somehow..

3. Runs Init in async

   That's all for now, but its a handy template for main py files
